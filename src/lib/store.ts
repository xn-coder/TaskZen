// Mock data (users, tasks) and related functions (getDenormalizedTasks, addTask, etc.)
// have been removed as the application now uses Supabase for data persistence.
// See src/lib/auth.ts for user authentication and src/lib/taskService.ts for task data management.

// Any constants that were here and are still needed should be in src/lib/constants.ts
// For example, TASK_PRIORITIES, TASK_STATUSES.

// The getTasksWithResolvedStatus logic is now incorporated into taskService.ts (processTask helper).
